# Device Maintainers Team

The device maintainers team is responsible for deciding about policies related
to the packaging, organization, and structure of devices in postmarketOS.

The team might set a maximum limit on member numbers to avoid endless
discussions.

## Becoming a member

To become part of the team, you must already be a maintainer of a device in at
least the `community` category. You may request adding yourself to
https://gitlab.postmarketos.org/teams/device-maintainers (WIP
https://gitlab.postmarketos.org/postmarketOS/gitlab-management-automation/-/merge_requests/1).

Members might be removed at the discretion of the team if innactive for longer
than 6 months.

## Responsibilities

* Be responsive (weeks) on policy discussions when pinged through
`@teams/device-maintainers`.
* Support the team on implementation of policies.
* Keep an open mind on new ideas to improve support for devices.

## Policies

The following policies are under the team responsibility:

* Rules for packaging device-specific information like firmware.
* Tools to use for building device-specific packages, e.g: kernels.
* Rules for device categorization.
* Reviews of device category changes.
* Review of deviceinfo variables.
